## Why Jekyll with GitBook

GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters
and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1]
is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages`
branch. It's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do version
control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template
for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed
to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are
changes to the original repo.

## Code highlight

The code highlight style is configurable the following entry in `_config.yaml`:

```

The default code highlight style is `colorful`, the full supported styles can be found from [the rouge repository][6]. Customized
style can be added to [./gitbook/rouge/](./gitbook/rouge/).

## How to generate TOC

The jekyll-gitbook theme leverages [jekyll-toc][4] to generate the *Contents* for the page.
The TOC feature is not enabled by default. To use the TOC feature, modify the TOC
configuration in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
toc:
    enabled: true
```
